Pipline for identifying viral sequences in metagenomic data
Modified by Changhai at 2022-09-30, referring to [virus identification SOP](https://www.protocols.io/view/viral-sequence-identification-sop-with-virsorter2-5qpvoyqebg4o/v3?step=3) from Sullivan lab written by Jiarong Guo et al.
This protocol shows how to use VirSorter2, checkV, DRAMv, HHblits and some manual curation criteria for viral sequence identification.
Also, there are a lot of viral sequences identification tools to be applied, such as VIBRANT, virFinder, PhiSpy etc, you can selecte as you prefer, [here](https://github.com/linsalrob/ProphagePredictionComparisons) is the comparison of these mainstream tools.
